\section{Analysis}
As part of the code improvement process the profiling programs gprof and MCprof were used to investigate the importance of the different functions in the application.
Since the matrix multiplication application only performs a single function (excluding print statements), the results were rather unsurprising and no further attention will be paid to them.
A call graph of a size 16 matrix multiplication is included in \cref{app:appendix-mcprof-result} for reference.
Contributions per team member are listed in \cref{app:appendinx-personal-analysis}.
