\subsection{Casper}

\subsection{Erwin}
NEON should be the fastest, based on experience from an earlier course with SIMD on the Intel platform.
A DSP is not terribly fast with matrix multiplications.
After running the profiling tool, the one function was the function to optimize as expected.
The DSP should really be used for streaming data, doing the init and setup for a one off is not worth the overhead.

\subsection{Lars}
The profiling tool showed that by far the matMult function was the one to optimize, this is quite obvious because there is only one function.
This was fairly trivial but it was required to do, because the process is extremely useful for the next assignment.
