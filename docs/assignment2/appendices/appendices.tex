Most of my efforts were focused on making implementations on DSP possible with shared memory and optimizing performance on the DSP side. I was disappointed by the room for improvement left in compiler optimizations. Despite the large amount of time spent on optimizing the compiler for the DSP side of the application very little (if any) improvement was obtained. Although perhaps this should not come as a complete surprise as the compiler is designed to optimise the performance as much as it can by itself.
