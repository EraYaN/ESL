\section{Comparison}
\label{sec:comparison}
In \cref{fig:comparison} the four implementation speed-up results are shown
An important thing to note is that if one uses the DSP, the GPP can do work at the same time.
The current implementation is a blocking operation on the GPP.
In this specific application it does not act as a pure accelerator but more as a way to offload the work to a secondary processing unit.
The DSP will also perform better if multiple matrices are streamed to the DSP so that the message queue is always full.
This way the DSP setup is done only once.
The NEON implementation is the fastest, at 20x speed-up. %TODO verify
Code complexity-wise the NEON implementation gives the most speed-up for the least amount of complexity increase.
Even by simply looking at the memory layout and implementation we can reach a 3x speed-up in the Optimised implementation.
