\section{Introduction}
For the course IN4342 -- Embedded Systems Laboratory, a mean shift visual tracking algorithm application is provided with a BeagleBoard to run it on.
These applications can be improved and significantly sped up by making optimal use of both the ARM SIMD instructions (NEON) and the digital signal processor (DSP) on the BeagleBoard.
This report discusses the results of the speed-up efforts for the mean shift application.
Attempts were made to speed-up the application by optimising it without the use of any additional features/hardware; by using NEON; by using the DSP and by using a combination of the two.
Performance improvements by means of using a fixed point integer representation in stead of floating point were also investigated.
First, the results of the profiling efforts will be discussed.
Then, multiple areas of possible improvement will be identified in the code and implemented.
Finally, the benchmarking results of the different implementations will be compared.
